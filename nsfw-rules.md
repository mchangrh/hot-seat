# Hot Seat NSFW Rules

**OVERVIEW** NSFW questions are played in the same way as regular Hot Seat cards; however, that’s where the similarities end. These questions are dirty, gross and sometimes a bit mean. For best results mix the NSFW questions with the original. Play at your own risk.

## House Rules
**STRAIGHT** Play with only the NSFW deck. Not for the faint of heart.

**SWAP** The player who drew the question can change one word before reading it out aloud.

**CHANGE UP** After drawing 3 card on your turn give one to another player, they are now in the Hot Seat. The player one left of the player who drew the 3 is the next player to draw 3.
